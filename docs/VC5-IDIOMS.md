# VC5 codegen idioms — read before matching any function

Every entry here was proven by a byte diff against BRGlide.dll, not inferred.
Add to this file whenever a new construct→codegen mapping is proven; this is
how per-function cost drops over time. Each idiom is solved ONCE.

## The method: infer the SOURCE from the bytes, never permute spellings

Trial-and-error spelling permutation is the slowest possible approach. When a
diff looks like register or width noise, ask what TYPE or STRUCTURE the
original source must have had to force those bytes.

Worked example (BrCarStatePack, 738 B, matched 2026-08-22): the original did
`mov bl,al` (byte) after a call where we emitted `mov ebx,eax` (dword). Not a
spelling problem — the original PROTOTYPE returned a char-width type.
Changing `int32_t BrFixPackS6Q7Neg/Level/U8Range(float)` to `int8_t` matched
the caller AND flipped a helper to match for free.

## Proven idioms

- **Flag-from-float:** `(f != 0.0f)` → `fld; fcomp [0.0 const]; fnstsw ax;
  test ah,0x40;` + jne/xor-vs-mov-1 branch pair. `(f != 0) ? 0x80 : 0` picks
  the constant into the mov.
- **Hoist order across calls is source left-to-right.** Subexpressions that
  must survive a call (flags into ebx/ebp, spills into stack slots) are
  hoisted in left-to-right source order. To hoist A before B, A's term must
  come first in the expression — or be a prior statement.
- **Shift distribution:** `(a*2 | b) << 1` gets the outer shift distributed
  into lea-scales. `((a << 1) | b) << 1` keeps the literal `shl`.
- **Accumulate stores:** `b[k] = x; b[k] |= y;` emits one store per statement
  with the value register-forwarded (no reloads). `t |= X; b[k] = t` leaves
  the or result in t's register; `b[k] = t | X` leaves it in al. The operand
  order of `|` itself is canonicalized — swapping does nothing.
- **Byte ops need byte types end to end:** `and bl,0x3f` / `shl al,6` come
  from uint8_t-typed locals and char-width return types, not from masks on
  ints.
- **Direct struct reads vs float locals:** both-memory products emit
  `fld [mem]; fmul [mem]`. A float local assigned from memory is copied via
  INTEGER mov to a stack slot and multiplied from the slot. A function mixing
  both (squares from locals, cross terms direct — BrRbBuildMatrix) shows the
  mix in the bytes; transcribe it, don't normalize it.
- **`(int)float` is always a `__ftol` CALL** (truncating). A bare `fistp`
  with no fldcw around it (round-to-nearest) CANNOT come from VC5 C —
  `/QIfist` does not exist in VC5 (warning D4002). Such code was inline
  `__asm` in the original and needs an asm-hybrid mechanism (none in the
  tree yet). First known case: BrDlCmdVtx 0x10021A20.
- **Statement reordering of a pure float DAG compiles to IDENTICAL bytes.**
  VC5 canonicalizes the DAG, so x87 scheduling residue (operand selection:
  `fld st5; fmul [mem]` vs `fld [mem]; fmul st5`; spill-slot count; fst vs
  fstp) is allocator-internal and NOT source-reachable. Documented wall
  class — see divergence-class triage. Do not burn time here.

- **Re-deref, don't cache:** the original often writes `*p` repeatedly and
  lets CSE cache it; an explicit `v = *p` local changes register allocation
  (VC5 reuses the local's register where the CSE shape burns a fresh one).
  Dropping the local matched BrSegPtrFixup (43 B) outright.
- **`(uint8_t)(x >> 20) & 1` vs `x & 0x100000`:** `mov edx,ecx; shr edx,20;
  test dl,1` comes from the byte-cast shift form. `test ecx,0x100000` comes
  from the plain mask. Read which one the original used off the bytes.
- **Allocator-internal residue in integer code:** which byte temp gets cl vs
  dl, and which register holds a loaded offset (eax vs esi), cascade locally
  then resync. Three different source shapes (temp decl order, reuse target)
  compile byte-identical — same wall class as float scheduling, but rarer
  and smaller. Land the structural match and move on.

- **Dead load:** `(void)*(volatile int32_t *)&p->field;` emits exactly one
  `mov` with no store. A plain local init is elided; a volatile LOCAL spills.
- **Zero-register (ebx) trigger:** VC5 dedicates a callee-saved register to
  the constant 0 when zero feeds many small STORES through branchy code.
  Ternaries (`c ? 0x80 : 0`) that compile to setcc/materialized ints can
  suppress it — spelling the same logic as branchy if/else stores flipped
  BrPadTranslate from 625 diffs to 220.
- **Switch operands are compared SIGNED** (`jg` not `ja`) — switch on
  int32_t, not uint32_t.
- **BR_THISCALL1 (`__fastcall`, one arg) reproduces thiscall exactly** —
  confirmed live on BrPadTranslate.
- **Switch vs else-if:** a 15-case sparse switch lowers to a binary compare
  tree; the equivalent else-if chain lowers to a LINEAR ladder (worse). But
  the tree's node form can still differ (compacted `cmp;jg;je` vs the
  original's `cmp;jg;cmp;je`) — an unresolved lowering-shape wall, first
  seen on BrInputIsDown.
- **The residue ceiling on big int functions:** four of five 490–700 B
  functions landed at 4–24 divergent bytes, every one an allocator choice
  (byte-reg pick, esi/edi role, imm-vs-pooled constant). Getting to that
  ceiling took 3–10 min each; crossing it needs a type/shape insight (as
  byte-width returns were for BrCarStatePack) or does not happen.

## Cost model (measured, 2026-08-22 timed test)

Size is not the cost driver — code shape is. 738 B of int/call-heavy code
matched in ~10 min; a 165 B float function (BrVec3Project) is permanently
stuck at 30 diffs of scheduling residue. Int/call-heavy code sustains
5–10 min/function at any size once the file's context is loaded. The float/
x87 cluster carries the walls and is a separate workstream.
