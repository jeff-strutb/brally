# Remastered lighting: measurements

Every number here comes from an instrument in the tree, with the command
that made it. Design: `DESIGN.md`.

## Phase 0: verification and the capture seam

### Facts settled from the code (2026-10-12)

- **Weather.** `BrRaceDifficultySet` (0x100627B0, `br_racestart.c`) sets four
  flags from the weather in the order Top Gear Rally's race set-up does
  (sunny, fog, rain, snow, night): 0 sunny, 1 fog, 2 rain (the storm), 3
  snow, 4 night. Night sets the night flag and not the rain flag: a dry
  night. The 32-bit lane's "4 = rain at night" note was wrong.
- **Reverse.** The physics has no gearbox (`br_cardrive.c`). Reverse is the
  car's control word bit 0x20000, which `br_carstep.c` turns into a negative
  drive torque (car+0xE68); a ghost or replay writes the negative torque
  itself (`br_carghostapply.c`). So: reverse lamps on while the drive torque
  is negative and the car is not moving forward; brake lamps as DESIGN.md
  2.3. The same for the player, the AI and ghosts.
- **The seam.** No handler wrappers are needed (the game itself rewrites
  table slots 4, 177 and 191 when the geometry mode changes, so wrappers
  installed once would be lost). Every display-list triangle, clipped or
  not, already tells `glide.c` its view before it is drawn (`br_dlview.h`),
  and arrives with its pixels and 1/w. The capture rebuilds the world point
  from them and the game's view x projection (`platform/light/light_capture.c`).
- **The backdrop.** The no-Z vertex routines set 1/w to 1/65535 after
  projecting (the painted sky and horizon). Those triangles have no world
  position; the capture keeps them apart as the backdrop.

### The capture, measured

`BR_VCLOCK=0.25 BR_HEADLESS=1 BR_LIGHT_CAPTURE=1 BR_LIGHT_STATS=1`, script
`20_quickrace_drive` (sunny), headless build `build/brally/light-null`:

| | |
|---|---|
| camera triangles a frame | 179 to 549 (median 520 on the opening straight, 232 later) |
| mirror triangles a frame | 0 (this camera has no mirror) |
| backdrop triangles a frame | 51 to 57 |
| largest reprojection error | 0.10 px (the rebuilt world point projected again, against where the game drew it) |
| world extent seen | x 811..1438, y 121..1175, z 0..26 (units) |

The game draws a few hundred triangles a frame: the scene is very light,
which is what DESIGN.md 8.1 counts on for the BVH.

*Frame 1,000 of `20_quickrace_drive` (`BR_LIGHT_DUMP=1000:f.obj`, a
software-renderer build, then `ports/brally/tools/lightviz.py`): the game's
frame; the 518 captured triangles drawn again through the game's camera, lit
flat by a test sun; the same triangles from behind and above the car.*

### The game never notices it

`ports/brally/tools/lightcheck.sh SCRIPT` (headless, `BR_VCLOCK=0.25`): the
script run with `BR_FLAG_LIGHTING=0` and `=1`, the game's data area dumped
every 100 frames, compared with `dumpdiff.py --state`.

| script | result |
|---|---|
| 20_quickrace_drive (sunny) | identical, 16 dumps |
| 27_quickrace_snow | identical, 17 dumps |
| 28_weather_rain | identical, 26 dumps |
| 29_weather_storm | identical, 26 dumps |
| 33_weather_fog | identical, 26 dumps |
| 38_views_keys | identical, 34 dumps |
| 21_quickrace_finish | identical except `g_aBrSfxChan` / `g_aBrSfxChanApplied` from frame 6600 |

The sound channels' records differ between two runs with the lighting OFF
in exactly the same place (frame 6600, the same two globals), so that is
existing run-to-run variation in the sound state, not the lighting.
`lightcheck.sh` leaves those two out and says so.

## Phase 1: first light (2026-10-12)

The Metal backend relights the camera's 3D view (`brr_metal.m`): each 3D
triangle writes a G-buffer beside the game's colour (albedo with the
vertex colour's brightness, the game's baked light, taken out; world
position; face normal), the frame's 3D triangles make a 2048^2 sun shadow
map, and one lighting pass computes the sun (with 3x3 filtered shadows),
the sky and the ground's light in lux, a GGX highlight, the camera's white
balance, an exposure metered from the frame's mean log luminance (EV100,
K = 12.5) and Khronos PBR Neutral. 2D, the mirror and the backdrop keep the
game's pixels. A headless Metal build (`HOST=null RENDER=metal`) takes the
shots without a window.

![Frame 1,000, Original and the new lighting](phase1-first-light.png)

*Frame 1,000 of `20_quickrace_drive`: Original (left), the new lighting
(right). The sun is the default direction, 19 degrees up, behind the gantry:
its shadow lies across the road.*

![Debug views](phase1-debug-views.png)

*`BR_LIGHT_VIEW` 1 albedo, 2 normals, 3 sun shadow, 4 the sun's angle on
each surface.*

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Original unchanged | frames 300, 1,000 and 3,000 byte-identical PNGs against the pre-lighting commit c8194344 (same Metal renderer, headless) |
| game state | `lightcheck.sh` with the lit Metal build: identical over `20_quickrace_drive` (16 dumps) |

Not yet: emissive lamps (the gantry's lights read as plain surfaces), the
sky (the game's painted backdrop is kept), shadows from what is off screen,
GPU timing.

## Phase 2: the cars' lamps (2026-10-12)

Every car in the race (`light_game.c` reads `g_aBrRaceDriver`: body frame,
velocity, drive and brake torque, control word, model extent) carries four
lamps (`light_scene.c`): low-beam headlights (about 20,000 cd, halogen
white, the UN ECE R112 asymmetric pattern in the shader) at night, in fog and
in rain; rear lamps (tail 5 cd red with the headlights, brake 80 cd, reverse
300 cd white) from the car's own brake and reverse state. Unshadowed for
now; the lamp positions are the faces of the model's extent (the lens faces
are the refinement).

Weather 4 is night: `28_weather_rain` runs it (`BR_LIGHT_STATS` prints
weather 4) and its frames are night (black sky, lit windows); the script's
"rain" comment is wrong.

Exposure: the lighting pass bins every 16th pixel's luminance into a
64-bin histogram; the mean log luminance between its 80th and 98.3rd
percentiles (Unreal Engine's auto-exposure defaults) sets EV100 (K = 12.5).
A plain mean failed at night: the moonlit dark pulled it to EV 1.4 and the
headlit road burned out; the histogram band meters EV 2.7 there. Night's
range is EV100 -2.5 to 7.5 (moonlight to a floodlit road).
